As of 2013, according to Rosenheim Advisors, investors rounded up with $2.8 billion dollars put into "spicing up" the conventional food market with technologies - that is a huge sum if compared with only $50 millions that were put into this field in 2008. The surprising thing is that the heavy sugar food startups are backed by a list of heavy investors with such well-known names as Bill Gates and Peter Thiel, Biz Stone and Evan Williams(Twitter founders), Jerry Yang (cofounder of Yahoo), Marc Cuban (owner of Mavericks), etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>My Second Article</title><link href="https://charithpathi.github.io/my-second-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-07T08:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-02-07T08:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Charith</name></author><id>tag:charithpathi.github.io,2023-02-07:/my-second-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love to eat healthy food but who has time to wash and cut up fresh food everyday.

But I knew I needed to eat a minimum of five servings of fruit and vegetables a day. Finally, I found an answer. So Vitamix is not a blender. Is it a juicer? Not by any means. I was tempted to get a cheap juicer as well. But juicers strain out the juice taking out all the nutritious pulp and fiber. Vitamix doesn't throw away any portion. You get the benefits of the whole food. Moreover, Vitamix breaks these foods down to the cellular level making them easy for the body to absorb. Now, my favorite part of owning a Vitamix is that it's self-cleaning. All I do is half fill it with water and a drop of all natural Sunshine Concentrate, turn it on for one minute and rinse. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>My First Article</title><link href="https://charithpathi.github.io/my-first-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-06T08:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-02-06T08:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Charith</name></author><id>tag:charithpathi.github.io,2023-02-06:/my-first-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most people that are dedicated to fitness go to the gym every day.
