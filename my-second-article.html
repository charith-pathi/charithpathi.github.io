    <p>I love to eat healthy food but who has time to wash and cut up fresh food everyday. I certainly don't. But I knew I needed to eat a minimum of five servings of fruit and vegetables a day. Finally, I found an answer. So Vitamix is not a blender. Is it a juicer? Not by any means. I was tempted to get a cheap juicer as well. But juicers strain out the juice taking out all the nutritious pulp and fiber. Vitamix doesn't throw away any portion. You get the benefits of the whole food. Moreover, Vitamix breaks these foods down to the cellular level making them easy for the body to absorb. Now, my favorite part of owning a Vitamix is that it's self-cleaning. All I do is half fill it with water and a drop of all natural Sunshine Concentrate, turn it on for one minute and rinse. That's it.</p>
